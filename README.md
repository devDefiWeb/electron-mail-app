# protonmail-desktop-app

[![Build Status: Linux / MacOS](https://travis-ci.org/vladimiry/protonmail-desktop-app.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/vladimiry/protonmail-desktop-app) [![Build status: Windows](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/yytvx09x43gif849?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/vladimiry/protonmail-desktop-app)

is an unofficial [ProtonMail](https://protonmail.com/) desktop client. It's basically the ProtonMail's [web interface](https://mail.protonmail.com) that's being opened inside [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) container with custom features built on top of it. You can see below the screenshots of the `default` and `compact` view modes.

## Build your own binary

- Regardless of the platform you are working on, you will need to have Node.JS v8 installed. Version 8 is required to match the Node.JS version Electron comes with. If you already have Node.JS installed, but not the version 8, then you might want you to use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to be able to work with multiple versions:
  - Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm).
  - Run `nvm instal 8`.
  - Run `nvm use 8`.
- [keytar](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar) module requires compiling prebuild node files and for that Python and C++ compiler need to be installed on your system:
  - **`On Windows`**: the simplest way to install all the needed stuff on Windows is to run `npm install --global --production windows-build-tools` CLI command.
  - **`On Linux`**: `python v2.7`, `make` and a C/C++ compiler toolchain, like `GCC` are most likely already installed. Besides there is a need to install `libsecret` dependency, see `Installing` section [here](https://github.com/atom/node-keytar).
  - **`On Mac OS X`**: `python v2.7` and [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/download/) need to be installed. You also need to install the `Command Line Tools` via Xcode, can be found under the `Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads` menu.
- [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) this project to your local device. If you are going to contribute, consider cloning the [forked](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) into your own GitHub account project.
- Install dependencies running `yarn`.
- Build app running `yarn run app:dist`. It's better to not touch a mouse during the process, since it might interfere with the `e2e` tests running at the end of the process.
- Build a package to install running `yarn run electron-builder:dist` command to build Windows/Mac OS X package and one of the following commands to build Linux package:
  - `yarn run electron-builder:dist:linux:appimage`
  - `yarn run electron-builder:dist:linux:deb`
  - `yarn run electron-builder:dist:linux:freebsd`
  - `yarn run electron-builder:dist:linux:pacman`
  - `yarn run electron-builder:dist:linux:rpm`
  - `yarn run electron-builder:dist:linux:snap`
- If you don't need a package to install, but a folder to execute app from, simply run `yarn run electron-builder:dir` command.  
- Outcome, whether it's a folder or package to install, comes into the `./dist` folder.
